<h3>About the Skinner Family Association</h3>
<p>
  The Skinner Family Association is a group of people who have organized their efforts in search of their Skinner ancestry.
Established in 1984, the pioneers of the Association wanted to have a place where they could collect material regarding the history and genealogy of the Skinner families and subsequently disseminate it to other researchers. The Association has grown to include lines not only from the United States, but also from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and Great Britain. In 1986, the Skinner Family Association became a member of the <a href="http://one-name.org/">Guild of One-Name Studies</a> located in England. As a one-named study, we collect information on all Skinner lines, not just from one particular family line or ancestral couple.  
</p>
<h3>The Skinner Scroll</h3>
<p>
    The Skinner Scroll was designed by Sande Skinner of Chicago, Illinois, in 1985 We wanted something to relate to the idea of a skinner - a worker in hides and leather. Wrote Sande: "<i>The vellum scroll is the connection as a leather worker had to prepare the animal skin to be suitable for writing.</i>"
