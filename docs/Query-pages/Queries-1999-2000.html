</p><p> 
</p><p>William Henry Skinner (1866-1931) m. Sarah Martha Polly (1862-1918). They had 2 sons Leonard ? (I heard a team of horses ran over him when he was very young) & Charles Walter Skinner - my great-great-grandfather. Born 01-15-1889 died 09-09-1961. He married Cynthia Ann Whipkey on 11-20-1912. They had 4 children Willie M. Skinner 12-25-1913 to 5-11-36 he was a very big man. Faye Marie Skinner 06-07-1918 to 07-27-1918. James Walter Skinner 09-18-1919 to 10-06-1991& Bessie Bell Skinner (my great grandmother) 03-14-1916 to 12-31-1991. I can bring the rest of the line down for you if you want. I am interested in knowing who William Henry's parents and grandparents are along w/siblings. He may have had a brother named Ed. I also have that he married Celia C. (probably your Ellia C.)
</p><p> 
</p><p>Charles Skinner his wife and children are all buried in Flynn Cemetery in Lincoln Cty? maybe Payne Cty. Oklahoma. Any info you have would be greatly appreciated.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Thank you for your time. Also include your link to William Henry. My grandfather will be very interested to know that he has family out there.

</p>
<p><p> 
</p><p>I am researching a Skinner family that may have been in Indiana in the 1860s, moved to Iowa and then south to Missouri (Clark County and Macon County). I have a Silas Skinner b. Jun 1863 in IN according to the 1900 Clark County Mo census. His parents were born in Ohio (father) and VA (mother). He is listed with his wife, Rosa b. Nov 1868 and sister in law Dollie Kildoo. Dollie and Rosa were born in IA and parents were born in KY (father) and Pennsylvania (mother). Dollie (or Dolla) Kildoo b. Nov 1885 married Marlin Skinner (his nickname was Poppy) b. 1886 and was born in MO according to the 1910 Clark County census. Marlin had a twin brother named Starlin.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Silas may be an older brother or cousin to Marlin Skinner. Marlin and Dollie moved to Idaho in 1915, where she died a couple of weeks later. They had one daughter, Opal b. 1907. Marlin then moved back to MO and subsequently remarried.
</p><p> 
</p><p>This has been a real dead end for me. I havent been able to connect them to any other Skinner families. Any help is very much appreciated.

</p><p>Okay... I think I might have some information for you. My grandfather was Ethel Skinner. He married Goldie Klingsmith and they had 13 children. They lived in the Clark and Moberly area in Randolph county MO for a majority of their lives. I'm not sure where grandfather was born, but my mother says it was somewhere in that area. At any rate, according to family rumor, Ethel's father immigrated from Scotland to Kentucky where he changed his name to Skinner. It was believed he changed his name to his Boss' name, however, one Aunt of mine says he was a mule skinner in the coal mines and that is why he changed his name to Skinner. If this rumor is indeed a fact, as I believe it to be (I can't connect myself to any other skinner's) then this could be why you cannot find your family... If you know anything about any Skinner's in the Central MO are, please contact me at this e-mail address

The house they lived in is still standing near where State Route 26 crosses Duck Creek. There sure were big catfish in Duck Creek then according to tales Grandpa told me. In the late 1870's the family moved to the Ravenswood District of Jackson County, West Virginia. Sarah Ann died March 3, 1890 and is buried at McGee Chapel near Sandyville. On February 11, 1890 Nathaniel married NANCY ADAMS. They were the parents of BESSIE SKINNER, born January 1, 1894. On December 4, 1902 he married Emily Chapman. He lived on Cherry Camp and is listed for taxes until 1906.

A biography of a family member published in 1905 includes the following information: Fourth generation of this line in America. John Skinner, progenitor, arrived from England and first settled in New Jersey.
</p><p>He had the following known children: Archie, Anna, William, George, Phebe, and "others who names can't be determined". His son William was born on 15 Nov 1757, and married Martha Duncan.They moved to Cumberland County in 1782, and their son Stephan was born there in 1783. In searching New Jersey Skinner records, I have targeted the Rev. William Skinner family of Middlesex County. The family names (John, William, Stephen) are correct. I would appreciate information on this and other possible families in the Garden State. Sincerely, Ed Wevodau wevo@gateway.net

</p>
<p><p> 
</p><p>From 5 June 1900 Federal Census, Pasadena Township, Los Angeles, CA 5 Precinct, Supr Dist No. 6, Enum Dist No. 117, Sheet No. 3, (3144 or 5144? B) Howard Street, No of family 60, she is shown as wife of Myron A. CRIPPEN, (age 65) also shown with Hawley O. Crippen, Grandson (age 10).
</p><p>The CRIPPEN family was very prominent in Branch County, MI, in 1835 thru 1900's. Myron and Ardessee were the parents of "The Mild Murderer" who killed his wife in London, England and was hanged in London for the crime. The murderer was Hawley Harvey Crippen, (1862-1910). There have been many books, plays, music, etc. written about Hawley, and his image is in the wax museum in London.
</p><p>In one book, written by Tom Cullen, it is stated that Myron Crippen married a local girl Andresse Skinner, which I have been unable to find proof, and have searched diligently. The Branch County Early Marriages (1833-1875 and 1876-1887) have been published here.
</p><p>In the local newspaper, The Courier, dated Nov. 21, 1910, pg 1, it states that Myron A. Crippen died Nov. 18th, in Los Angeles, CA caused by privations and worry over his son's fate AND that his wife died several years since.
</p><p>I would appreciate an obit on both Myron & Ardessee, info on where they are buried in the Los Angeles area. Mostly I would like information about Ardessee's family, where born, father & mother, any siblings, etc. from that area, or in Pennsylvania.

</p><p>Hello there, all Skinners around the world. I am Pieter Retief Skinner from Pretoria, South Africa. Gather most info for your site is generated is the USA and I feel oblidged to let you know that our line goes way back in South Africa's history and particularly in the establishment of the city of Pretoria.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Our forefather, William (a barrister), was born in Canterbury, Kent, England in 1828 and came to what was still a very unsettled Southern Africa on a hunting expidition in the mid 1800's. Together with two French brothers, Duvereux (I think this was the spelling) they stumbled on part of what was called "the great trek", the famous team leader (called "boer") was a French/Dutch decendant named Pieter Retief who was murdered with one of his sons by the Zulu, a black tribe.
</p><p> 
</p><p>William married Retief's daughter Deborah and they settled in Pretoria. He worked as the first Landrost of Pretoria under Paul Kruger, the Boer leader and today Skinner Street is a landmark here and incidentally the widest street in Pretoria.
</p><p> 
</p><p>The Skinners are now spread far and wide around South Africa. Anyone interested in mailing me with comments or wanting to chat about our local clan may do so at sorgsa@lantic.net

</p><p>married Ann Wright, daughter of Robert Wright in 1690. He died on 5/12/1727 in Woodbridge, NJ. One of his sons, Nathaniel I
</p><p>married Elizabeth King in 1735. Richard is also referred to as Deacon Richard Skinner but am unsure what denomination.
</p><p>You also are seeking the children of Ruben Skinner. What I have shows a marriage to one Sara Higgins, granddaughter of Zerah
</p><p>Higgins. The children and spouses are:
</p><p> 
</p><p>1. Mary Skinner and Jacob Rush
</p><p>2. 2nd Rev. Nathaniel and Elizabeth Harned
</p><p>3. Joseph Skinner
</p><p>4. Rev. James Skinner and a. Elizabeth ? and b. Catharine McClung

Henry and his parents and three other siblings Jeremiah, Sariah, Anna Catherine, moved to Tennessee.

</p><p>My Great Grandfather was William Henry Skinner born, I think, about the time you are looking for. He was one of several children from the Carolina's whose parents passed away young and the siblings were split up among family members.
</p><p> 
</p><p>William Henry ended up in Athens, Alabama and married. He then moved to Jefferson County, Alabama. My Grandfather was Thomas Julian Skinner and he and William Henry are listed in the Skinner Family page. My father, Thomas Julian Skinner Jr. passed away last year. I am the III and my oldest son is the IV and my grandson is the V. We don't know anything about my family past William Henry. Maybe there is a connection with you. We have located a burial site with a Thomas Julian Skinner in Marengo County, Alabama, but we know of no connection with him. He lived from 1830+- to after the Civil War.

</p><p>In making my connection with Daniel SKINNER's daughter, Sarah (b. 1775), I noticed a reference # (Reference: 14288 ). Is this number a reference to some document? (Note to Richard: reference numbers are just those assigned by the program. Gregg)
</p><p> 
</p><p>My purpose for the question is to verify, through a document, that John CONKLIN (b. 1779), husband of Sarah SKINNER (b. 1775) is the son of William CONKLIN (b. 1754) and Elizabeth Brink CONKLIN (b. 1758)

</p><p>I am still looking for those elusive Skinner family cousins. I have seen a lot more have joined so am hoping to find someone that can connect to my Lorenzo D. Skinner family line. Lorenzo was b. in Virginia 1813 and married a Delilia Phifer Nov. 24 1835 in North Carolina. They had these children Henry b.1836 no other info would like to find a connection to someone, Jeremiah my ggrandmother b. 1838 married Adaline {Addie} Kirby would like to find info on her, Sariah/Sarah 1840 no info and would like to find some. Anna Catherine b. 1847 married a Casswell Wheeler Nov 10, 1864 Blount County, Tennessee, would like to find out more on her and her family. Sometime after the last birth this family of Skinners moved to Cocke County, Tennessee, they had two more children. James b. 1850 no info at all on him would like to find a connection. Rebecca b. 1852 no info at all on her either. I can help anyone with the family Jeremiah and descendants there after, but nothing on this ggggrandfather of mine, Lorenzo. I have a web site/page for anyone to check if you wish, at the following.

</p><p>I am looking for a Lou SKINNER, she married a SM (Sam Meads) GRIFFIN on Dec 16, 1880. She was from Georgia. Her father was a Dr. SKINNER. She died December of 1918 and is buried in Whitehouse TX. I would appreciate any information that someone may have. Their children were: Kurt, Noel, Grace, Roy, Idus, Mary, Carl, Lucille. The only information I have on Dr. Skinner is that he may have been murdered? He was to have taken a horse & buggy to a call in the night, when the horse returned it contained a body, we presume that it was Dr. Skinner. It is just family stories so I don't have any conclusive evidence.

</p><p>EBENEZER SKINNER
</p><p> 
</p><p>I am in search of the ancestry of my ggggggrandfather, Ebenezer SKINNER, b. 1766. I believe he married Mary COOK or CROOK. Their children were Harvey (b. 1803) and Almond (b. ca 1814). I found a reference to Ebenezer in a book about Monroe County, New York, which identified him as a British Loyalist and stated that he lived in Canada part of his life.
</p><p> 
</p><p>My question is, who are Ebenezer's parents? I have heard rumors that he is the son of Benjamin Skinner, son of Joseph Skinner and Martha Kinne. Benjamin apparently did have a son named Ebenezer, possibly born 1766. But none of the records about my Ebenezer that I've found so far mention his parents' names, and none of the records I've found about Benjamin Skinner's son Ebenezer mention his children, so I can't make a definitive connection.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Can anyone help me make a connection? You can see the information I've already collected at

<p><p> 
</p><p>Dear Skinner Kinsmen:
</p><p> 
</p><p>I am inquiring about a John G. Skinner (or John J. Skinner) who was an early pioneer in Mississippi. He came into the area that is now Oktibbeha County immediately upon the signing of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek in which the Choctaw Indians ceded their lands to Ms. He was a farmer and politician. Was elected to the first Board of Police, was the second probate judge of the county, and represented Oktibbeha County in the Ms. Legislature 1838-1840. He was known as "the most active man in town."
</p><p> 
</p><p>There was also a Louisa Skinner who married Jesse Merideth in Oktibbeha County in 1871. In the 1870 Ms. Census Oktibbeha County she is listed as 27 years old, and native of Georgia. She is living in the household of Jesse M. whom she married the next year. She had a one year old son named John T. E. (?) Louisa is listed under the name of Elizabeth Morgan, also from Georgia, who was mother of Jesse's first wife, Mary Morgan. Louisa may have been a Morgan, now widow of a Skinner. Jesse Merideth and Louisa Skinner Merideth had four sons, one of whom is the ancestor of my two Merideth sons.
</p><p> 
</p><p>I am writing a Merideth family history and would very much appreciate any information regarding the two above named Skinners, as they have a relation to this Merideth famiily.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Many thanks. I shall look forward to hearing from some of you.

<p><p> 
</p><p>I have never posted a query on the internet, so please be patient with me. I have been searching for the parents of Merzy (Mirza) Skinner who was born circa 1795, possibly in Canada, according to 1850 Franklin Co., VT census records. I am reasonably certain that Merzy married Rachel Lovewell, daughter of Robert and Polly Taplin Lovewell, but have never found a marriage certificate, as yet. Rachel was born March 20, 1795 in Vermont.
</p><p>Merzy and Rachel had the following children:
</p><p>Irene Saphronia;
</p><p>Paulina (my great grandmother);
</p><p>Hannah and Harris (twins);
</p><p></p>
<p>Robert; Merzy Jr.;
</p><p>Mary Ann and
</p><p></p>
<p>Nathan L.,
</p><p>all in St. Albans, Franklin Co., VT. They are buried in the St. Albans Bay Cemetery beside Robert and Polly Lovewell. Merzy died October 29, 1868 and Rachel died September 16, 1891, due to old age, 96 yrs., 6 mon. 23 da. I do know that their son, Mirza Jr., was a Civil War veteran and settled in Republic Co., KS and is buried in the Ida Cemetery there, with his family. The town of Munden, Kansas, was founded on part of his homestead. Merzy and Rachel's daughter, Paulina, married Martin Joseph Corliss. Their children: John Anson; Mirza George; Joseph Addison; Mary Lovell (possibly Lovewell); Amy Melissa; Daniel Todd; Norman Lasell; Albert Nathan (my grandfather). Martin Joseph and Paulina Skinner Corliss are also buried in the same cemetery in St. Albans. I have been gathering information on their descendants for years. I want very much to locate Merzy's (Mirza's) parents and hopefully make a connection to other Skinners, which will take me back to the land from whence they came to America.

</p><p>Scotland.Their names were James and John.Perhaps they married and had many descendents like Arthur did in N.Z. I am trying to

</p><p>Hello cousin!
</p><p>I am a descendant of Richard Skinner and Susanna Poulain too. I am seeking info on him as well. I have seen some info at the LDS search site that shows Susanna's parents but nothing about Richard. About all I have been able to determine is that Richard was probably on the Isle of Jersey in the Channel Islands before he came to NJ. What about you? Curious to see what you have.

</p><p>My paperwork is packed away at the moment, but, I am sure that your JOHN SKINNER is from the JOSEPH SKINNER line that came from Connecticut. He was killed circa 1760. His son DAVID was the first to raft down the delaware river. DAVID and several of his brothers settled SULLIVAN CO,NY NEWTON,SUSSEX,NJ AND WAYNE CO,PA. I believe that your JOHN is couple of generations down from Joseph, but this line goes back to the 1600's to THOMAS of Malden,Ma.
</p><p> 
</p><p>As far as CALKINS, this line comes from OLIVER CALKINS and this line also goes back to approximately the same time.
</p><p></p>
<p> 
</p><p>Both of these lines are well documented, there is a book about the Calkins/Caulkins family also, several on the Skinners. As well as any of the county histories/atlas. I will however try to get some specific info if I have it. Hope this sparks your interest,

My grandfather moved to New jersey, married Catharine Highland and gave birth to my father, William Augustin and to my uncle John Skinner. I would love to have some information on the family back before my grandfather. Can anyone help me? My grandfather was in his 40's when he died, my dad was in his teens. Any help would be appreciated!

</p><p>I am looking for information on Alexander Skinner and his parents. He's my 4th g-grandfather. He was born in Charles Co. MD. about 1775. He married about 1804 to Catherine Caroline Scatt, the daughter of Rev. James Scott from Scotland, and And Sarah (Brown) Scott. It has been pasted down in the family that Alexander aquired a conderable amount of land in VA. (1806-1807) He brought slaves with him to clear the land and a tree fell on him and killed him. Sometime from Jan. 1807, before 31 May 1807, the was his 2nd son was born, his dad was dead at the time of his birth. This land was later known as Confluence,and is in either in Harrrison or Lewis co of that time. Of this time since the civil war it's become known as Orlando, WV. It lays partly in Lewis Co. and partly in Braxton co. WV. I have 4 generations down if anyone wants to share.
</p><p>Anything back on Alexander would be nice.

</p><p>Seeking information on the parents of Cornelius Skinner b. 1769 in Loudoun Co. Virginia. He married Jane Carr and migrated to Weschester, Clark County Kentucky. There is a possibility that his father is Phineas Skinner s/o Cornelius Skinner Jr. There is a sentence in the familly bible of Phineas Carr Skinner son of Cornelius and Jane Carr (awkwardly written) which states "Phineas Skinner grandson who owned this bible came to Missouri (Platte County) from Clark Co. Kentucky where he was born in 1801." I am hoping that this Phineas Skinner is the grandfather of the Phineas Carr Skinner who owned the bible. This bible was copied in July 15, 1936 by Mrs. John Georgen (wife of the owner of the Bible at the time) for a D.A.R. project. It lists marriages and birth dates of that line of the family. I descend from Azubah Skinner, d/o Cornelius Skinner and Jane Carr. She married Joel Franklin Chiles and migrated to Jackson County, Missouri. I found the copy of the Bible Entries in the Mid-Continental Genealogical Library in Independence, Missouri and would be happy to do look ups or even submit to this site.

Had children: Sir Henry Wyatt, born abt 1500; Margaret Fransje Wyatt b 1502/1514; Sir Knight Thomas Wyatt, born abt 1503; and Mary Wyatt born abt 1509. Sir Knight Thomas Wyatt is my direct line to Ann/Anne Skinner and Sir Henry Wyatt/Wyott.

<p>From:  "Susan M. Berry" sberry@nfo.edu

<p><p> 
</p><p>I'm trying to locate information on my great-great grandmother (and mystery woman), Mariah J. Skinner. According to census reports, Mariah was born in either Alabama or Mississippi ca. 1822. She married John W. Fancher, Jr., in Noxubee County, Mississippi, on 19 May 1842, but later they lived in Union Parish, Louisisana. Circumstantial evidence suggests that Mariah was closely related both to Caroline Frances Skinner Youngblood and also to Morris Skinner, although no one has yet figured exactly what the relationship was. We do know that all three were in Noxubee County in the mid-1840s, and apparently moved together to Louisiana. Mariah and John Fancher, Caroline and Abraham Youngblood, and Morris and Mary Skinner are shown living near each other in the 1850 U.S. census for Union Parish, Louisiana. I am descended through Mariah's daughter Mary Elizabeth (Mollie) Fancher, born in 1854, who married William Thomas Morton. Mariah and husband John Fancher, Jr., both died during the Civil War years, and daughter Mollie and her two brothers were apparently raised by a Fancher uncle. I am in touch with several of Caroline Skinner Youngblood's descendants, who are equally interested in solving the mystery of Mariah. Can anyone help?

</p><p>My Great Grandfather was William Skinner, a Civil War Navy Veteran who was enlisted under the name William Munovan. I'm not sure of the spelling. He was in the Queen's Navy and jumped ship in Boston to join the Union Navy. He said the captain of the Canadian ship was brutal, and that he feared for his life, which might explain why he chose to join the navy of a country at war. He is buried in Millinocket Maine where he died in 1918. He had many children, but the only son to live to have a son was my Grandfather, Edward M. Skinner. I, of course, was named after my father who was named after his Grandfather. My father was born in Maine in 1911. I was born in Maine in 1949. I do not know the name of my great grandmother, but my paternal grandmother was a Guiggey from New Brunswick, Canada. She died in 1961, and my grandfather in 1970. Both are buried in Millinocket, Maine.

Skinner b. 1892 in Berden, Kansas and died in 1965 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma , that was married to Margaret E. Hamerick b. 1901 in Illinois, then to Wylma Elizabeth Browning. Blane was a teamster by Occupation and white. Margaret was also white but she was just a housewife. I have in front of me the childs(older mans) name at the time of birth and the adopted name. Can you please help this man, if you can't, tell me where to look. I thank you.

<p><p> 
</p><p>I'm searching for information on The Newfoundland Skinners. Here's what I
</p><p>have so far:
</p><p> 
</p><p>Thomas B. Skinner married Julia Lamb in St. John's Newfoundland before 1900.
</p><p>They had four children-
</p><p>1. William B. Skinner, my grandfather- b. 1900, d. 1968, m. Mary Ann Horan also of St. Johns, May 18, 1928. They emigrated to Bellmore, NY and had four children. Thomas P., who had six children William B., my father who also had since children, Patrick James Jeremiah, who has two children, and Ann Skinner, who never married.
</p><p>2. Patrick James Skinner, Archbishop of Newfoundland from 1951-1979-b. 1904, d. 1988.
</p><p>3. Joseph Skinner, moved to Vancouver, Canada.
</p><p>4. Mary Elizabeth Skinner, never married.
</p><p> 
</p><p>I'm especially looking for information on Thomas B., Julia and Joseph. Joseph left Newfoundland for Vancouver and was never heard from again. All I do know is that he has passed away and that he was married and divorced and that he did have children.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Thank you for any help! There are plenty of us Skinners now living in the North Jersey and NYC vicinity and we'd love to trace our heritage back a bit further.

</p><p> 
</p><p>SKINNERS and HOLLANDS
</p><p> 
</p><p>The Skinners and Hollands intermarried twice. Three Skinner brothers, EMMANUEL, SAMSON, AND CORDIE came to the U.S. form England before the Revolutionary War and settled in Virginia. Emmanuel was a Baptist Preacher. After the war, because Virginia had adapted a "state religion" like that in England amd the Baptist Preachers were persecuted there by putting them in jail, Emmanuel left Virginia and settled in what was then called Tennessee County, North Carolina. The area is now known as Robertson County, Tennessee. There were also two Skinner girls that married Hollands, one was DANIEL and one was WILEY.
</p><p> 
</p><p>It is listed in deed book that Emmanuel bought 195 acres and he gave 2 acres of that land for a Baptist Church to be built, and ground for a church cemetary. The deed listed the beliefs of Baptists (the same as it is today-noted 1931-1935-) and said that if the church strayed from those beliefs, the land was to be returned to his family. He stated also that the church could get drinking water from his well and baptize in his creek.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Church records showed that the first house was a crude log house but later was a frame building, then later a brick house. A plaque there shows him as pastor from 1802-?
</p><p>

<p><p> 
</p><p>Hi, to all fellow Skinners,
</p><p> 
</p><p>I have just found this site and would like to add my family to it.
</p><p> 
</p><p>So far I have traced my family back to George Skinner b:1796/7 at Ash Priors, Somerset, England. He was a doctor and practiced in Bath, England; married Jane Elizabeth Skinner (I believe his cousin). They had seven children that I know of:
</p><p>George Henry 1824-1824, (Dr)George Robert 1825-1856, Jane Maria 1827-1870, Henry 1830-1904, Charles Edward 1832-1838, (Dr)William 1833-1908 and Jane Elizabeth ?-1838.
</p><p> 
</p><p>George died in 1872 and is buried either at Lansdown cemetry or Bishops Lydeard...I cannot find confirmation of his parents, his marriage or his death.His parents may have been John Skinner and Betty(Elizabeth) Joyce...but cannot prove it.
</p><p></p>
<p> 
</p><p>I am descended from Henry(1830-1904). He married Anna Jenkins in 1863 in Monksilvera, arrived in Brisbane (Australia) around 1864.
</p><p> 
</p><p>If anyone feels they have any information, or if I can help anyone with anything I would love to hear from you.

I had not even tried working on the Skinners because they were so numerous and I did not know where to start. We suspected that her father was Hugh because she is buried with a Hugh Skinner in the Jonesburg, Missouri cemetary and we figured that was her brother. Anyway. Thank you again. Is there a way to connect with other Skinner descendants from the same family? We also have a Skinner connection to another family. My husband's South family plugs into Spicy Skinner who married John South.

</p><p>I am searching for the parents of Mary C. Skinner, b.Abt 1812 MD, who married William Leeper,b.1795 PA. She was married in 1832 in Montgomery Co.,Ohio, raised a family with him in York Twp.Darke Co.,Ohio and died Abt.1885. Their children were Cephus M.,b.1835, William G.,b.1839, Harriet L.,b.1842, Samuel,b.1846, Mary Anna("Annie"),b.1848, Sarah Cecilia ("Tadie"), b.1851, and John E.,b.1856. Samuel and Harriet both died young, Cephus raised a family in Darke Co. and Sarah married a Shiverdecker and raised a family in Miami Co. William left Ohio, to "Go West", Johnny moved to IN, and we think that Annie did too, but that's not verified.

</p><p>Myself and some of my family were talking about the origin of the Skinners that have lived in Kenilworth, Warwickshire England. In the conversation my uncle told me of article that he had read recently. Basically this article states that the king of England in the early part of the 14th century frequently visited Kenilworth castle on his travels. On one stay he had a sexual affair with a village girl. She was married to a Skinner, she fell pregnant soon after this affair. It was suggested that the baby may have been the son of the king, however, it was brought up as a skinner. I wanted to know whether you had ever read an article like this because I question the truth behind it.

</p><p>Hello, I have just found your site by accident. I am researching an ancestor who came from England with his brothers and wife about 1874.His name is Charles Skinner who came to Canada. It is thought he had brothers, one who might be James or John who went to the States and found Skinner Satin. My mother received a letter from lawyers in the States some years back asking that she contact them however she never did. I would like to hear from you in the event we may be able to determine that we are dealing with the same family. Thanks.

As a result of the information, I wonder if you are related, or know of someone who is related, to Frank Skinner who was quite well know in the Music Side of the Movies in Hollywood and surrounding areas during the late 19200s through the mid 1940s.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Let me explain why I am interested: My grandmother, Elizabeth Beeley had a sister named Mary Ann Beeley who married John Freeman(?) SKINNER in Arenzville, Cass County, Illinois. They had several son's and daughters. A son, Chester Milton SKINNER, had a son, Frank Chester Skinner, who was the family member who became famous in the Hollywood Music business. He was a composer, arranger and music director, among other activities.
</p><p> 
</p><p>I have not been able to find when, or where he died, and whom his descendants might be.
</p><p>Any information you might have on the gentleman will be most appreciated.

</p><p>Hi all you Skinners
</p><p> 
</p><p>I am now looking for all Skinners from Mechlenburg County, North Carolina from 1830-1840-1850 census. I am particularly interested in the following names found. William Henry, Jeremiah, Lorenzo D. Charles, Mary. My family from Lorenzo m. a Delilia Phifer and Mary Skinner married Peter Phifer. I believe that Mary is the sister of my Lorenzo. Peter is the brother of Delilia. I believe that Jeremiah is the older brother by 2-3 years he came to Mechlenburg first and then William Henry Skinner, with I believe Lorenzo at 17 years old. I found a William Henry Skinner I believe to be his brother.
</p><p> 
</p><p>I believe and it is pretty conclusive that any Skinners in the county at this time is all belonging to one family. If you have info or can connect to any of these Skinners would you please contact me. AT SPritch209@aol.com thank you.

</p><p> 
</p><p>My GGGG Grandparents - Robert Elder & Mary Mendey - had 8 known children in the Bethnal Green / St. Leonards / Chelsea districts of East London between 1819 and 1841.
</p><p> 
</p><p>The youngest of their children was Louisa Elder born 1841. In 1862 Louisa married Philip Lyons, and we know that they had at least one son - Philip - in ca. 1865.
</p><p> 
</p><p>The next I know of Louisa is on the 1881 Census where we could not find a couple matching the descriptions of Louisa and Philip Lyons, but in desperation I looked for a son Philip ... and then found that Louisa had remarried ... the census showed the following :-
</p><p> 
</p><p>12 Goldsmith Square, Shoreditch, London.
</p><p>George Skinner Age 42 Born Middlesex, England.
</p><p>Boot Finisher
</p><p>Louisa Skinner Age 40 Born Middlesex, England.
</p><p>Silk Weaveress
</p><p>Phillip Lyons Age 16 Born Middlesex, England.
</p><p>Step son of George
</p><p>Boot Laster
</p><p> 
</p><p>I have as yet been unable to find a marriage between George & Louisa between 1865 and 1881 ... am still looking ... but am interested to know if you might have any information regarding SKINNERS in London, which might be of some use to me in my search !? I do not know as yet whether George & Louisa had any children of their own.

</p>
<p><p> 
</p><p>Hello cousins!
</p><p>I just finished looking over Marion Turk's book "The Quiet Adventurers in North America." I don't recall the page number but she seemed to have her doubts about the Channel Island origins of Richard. She wasn't sure if the family should have been included. But what caught my attention was the mention that the ship, The Philip, stopped in New York and Virginia before arriving in Elizabethtown, NJ. Could our Richard have come from one of those 2 places? I ask because no one has been very forthcoming about the Philip and any documents associated with it; no record of Richard's birth in Jersey; no record in Hampton, England that I could find through GenForum/UK. So, I am wondering if we have overlooked something.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Additionally, I wonder if a valet would also be a carpenter. One researcher purported claims Richard was Philip Carteret's valet. Again, no one at the Channel Islands Genforum has come forth with any records. Would a person have had such diverse occupations during the 1640-60's? I am not very familiar with that sort of history. I would appreciate any thoughts, verifications, denials, whatever with regard to this theory. Thanks for your input.

<p><p>Robert Skinner and Anne Storer// Adderton Skinner// Henry Skinner// Walter Skinner. My question is did this Walter Skinner have a son named Walter Skinner who was born in Carroll County Maryland and was married to Salina Davis. Does any of your past newsletters include Robert Skinner of Calvert County Marylands' descendents to the level of Walter Skinner's son Walter Skinner???
</p><p></p>

<p><p> 
</p><p>I am searching for the Skinner line of my family. My great-grandmother was Mary Skinner born about 1885 in NY (possibly NJ) to Viola Baldwin Skinner and Jacob Skinner. Mary had a brother Rufus Skinner. We know that Jacob died and Viola Baldwin lived in her mother-in-law's (Mrs. Skinner) boarding house (in NY? NJ?). She then met Joseph Horson from Brighton, England and married him (and had a child, Beatrice).
</p><p> 
</p><p>Any information on Jacob Skinner, Viola Baldwin Skinner or their descendants would be VERY appreciated. !Who was the Jacob Skinner's mother who ran the boarding house?)

</p>
<p><p>In the course of searching the ancestry of my Grand Father, William SKINNER, I have discovered that he was born in Ellon in Aberdeenshire on 24 May 1840, worked as a boat builder at Cullen in Bamfshire until there was a serious accident during the launching of a fishing dorie which put an end to the building of dories at Cullen.
</p><p></p>
<p>William then set out for Otago in New Zealand arriving in 1868, subsequently meeting David MILLAR, who with his wife Marion (nee YOUNG) who arrived in Otago aboard the Philip Laing in 1848. They had a daughter Marion who was 6 months old on arrival, and there was born a daughter Jane, who married my grand father William SKINNER on 16 Dec 1879.
</p><p></p>
<p>Both William and Jane died when the family were young, and as my Dad never discussed family history I can find no information relating to grand father William's family history beyond the date of his birth in 1840. Dates and family history here in New Zealand have been verified from records mostly in the Otago Early Settlers archives.
</p><p></p>
<p>I have already contacted the Scottish Ancestral Roots research organization but so far have had no response from them.
</p><p></p>
<p>Thanking you in anticipation,

<p> 
</p><p>**********************************************************************
</p><p> 
</p><p>I am looking for any descendants of Thomas SKINNER and Martha Ann BREADMORE who married at Brightwalton, Berkshire in January 1881. Thomas, aged 25, was a butler in East Woodhay, Hampshire later in 1881.
</p><p> 
</p><p>I am wondering if there were there any children of the marriage? Do you
</p><p>have any records of this family?
</p><p> 
</p><p>Any information would be appreciated.
</p><p> 
</p><p>***********************************************************************
</p><p> 
</p><p>Recently I have discovered a Thomas Breadmore SKINNER from Southsea who was killed in action on 15 September 1916 - details on the Commonwealth War Graves web site - wife Ada Alice.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Do you have knowledge of Thomas Breadmore SKINNER or information that would help me establish who his parents were as I am sure there must be a connection to the BREADMORE family.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply!

</p><p>and Willie Ellen Skinner (17 August 1890-27 October 1983) married Edward L. Brodie (17 December 1880-27 December 1965) and
</p><p>settled in Wagoner County, Oklahoma.
