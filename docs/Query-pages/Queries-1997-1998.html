</p><p>You inquired about William A. Skinner or Orange County FL in the 1800's. We moved to Orlando (Orange County) FL in 1953. My father was Will A. Skinner and I'm Jr. When we moved to Orlando there was only one other Skinner in Orange County at the time. We did research to see if there had previously been other Skinners. As far as we were able to ascertain they weren't. Doesn't mean that there couldn't have been for various and sundry reasons; i.e. the Orange County Courthouse burned on a least one and maybe two occasions and records were lost. My grandfather was William Lafayette Skinner of Monroe County AL. I would be interested in knowing if you obtain any other information.
</p><p>If I can help you in any way please advise.

Moved to Buchanan MO by 1840, married Elizabeth Moultrie in 1841, then Isabelle Walkup in 1845. He moved from Buchanan Co MO to Page Co IA by 1860, and died there in 1900. Could you once again see if you might possibly have any information on my Joshua?
</p><p> 
</p><p>There was a Phinneas Skinner (don't know if I spelled Phinneas right) who was in Platte Co MO about 1850 and 1860. I found a land patent for this Phinneas Skinner in Buchanan Co MO ca 1840. It was very close to where the Moultrie family lived. Since Joshua first married a Moultrie, I'm thinking that this Phinneas might have been a brother. Do you have any information Phinneas, such as parents?

</p><p>One of my ancestors, "William Nevil Lambdin" (a shipbuilder) married "Ruth Skinner" (born March 28, 1778 died March 21, 1870....buried behind St. Luke's Methodist Church, in St. Michaels, Talbot Co., MD), on October 3, 1798, in Talbot County (probably St. Michaels). I feel that the records you are looking for, are in that area.
</p><p> 
</p><p>It is possible that Ruth had a brother who might be your great-great-grandfather, (father of your great-grandfather). Ruth's father was "John Skinner" and her mother was "Ruth" (nee?).

</p><p>Dear Don:
</p><p> 
</p><p>Your grandfathers name was Eli Morris Skinner born 14 June 1845 in Perry co., Ohio. He married Mary Eve Buchman 30 May 1867 in PerryCo., Ohio. Eli died 2 Oct 1925 in Glenrock, Converse, Wyoming.
</p><p> 
</p><p>His father is our elusive Skinner. We haven't pinpointed his exact father, but we know which family it was. We believe his father was John Slathiel Skinner, son of Samuel Skinner born 20 Nov 1757 in Bedford Co., Pa. He was the son of Samuel Sr. born 1729/34 of Woodbridge, NJ. who married Agnes Critchfield . His father was Nathaniel Skinner who married Elizabeth King.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Eli seems to have disappeared, and lots of investigation is being done to find proof.
</p><p> 
</p><p>My grandfather was Richard Skinner brother of Eli Morris Skinner. I would be more than glad to help you on anything I can. Take care.

<p><p> 
</p><p>Hello:
</p><p> 
</p><p>My name is Mary Skinner and I am a direct descendant of Major Skinner. This is what I can tell you about him from an article that appeared in the Richmond County History, Vol. 10, No. 1 Winter, 1978:
</p><p> 
</p><p>It is said that Major William Skinner cam to Georgia, either before or after the Revolutionary War. He was granted land in Screven and apparently George Washington had breakfast there in 1791.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Major Skinner and his wife Elizabeth had seven children. The oldest, John was born in 1786. The others were William, Thomas, Caroline, Seaborn, Linvingston, and Sallie. In 1806 Major Skinner and Seaborn Jones traded lands owned by Jones in Richmond Country for those owned by Skinner in Screven Country. The Major then went on to acquire large land holdings around Augusta, GA, including what is now the site of Augusta College.
</p><p> 
</p><p>The Major's oldest son John, had two sons John and William and they stayed on the land. William had a son, William H. Skinner and he had a son William Skinner. William Skinner was married to Jane E. Skinner and they had a daughter, Jesse and a son, John Seaborn. John Seaborn was my grandfather. My father, William Allan was his only son. One thing I can tell you about this branch of Skinners -- they were all extraordinarily tall -- Jane's obituary says she was married to the "largest man in the state" and my father, my brother, me and my sister are 6'0" plus.
</p><p> 
</p><p>If you are able to find anything more about the Skinners of Screven and Richmond County -- I would be most interested.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Thanks,
</p><p>

His mother had John Wesley 6 weeks after arriving in America. I appreciate any information that you can give me.

</p><p>Hi Rod:
</p><p> 
</p><p>I was born and brought up in Reading, Mass. I have many relatives in New England.
</p><p>My father, WILLIAM grandfather, ARTHUR and Great grandfather, JOSIAH were all from Ochre Pit Cove in Conception Bay (on the east coast) Our family have been trying to out when and what descendants came from England. We think either Dorset or Devon area. It seems that most of the immigration ships sailed out of Liverpool. My stepfather-in-law was also a Skinner- VINCENT. My grandfather told us once that his grandfather was one of 4 brothers. One of them landed in Ochre Pit Cove and another in Fogo Island. That's where Vincent is from. We might be related!! Wouldn't that be a kick!! Would love any information you can find out about the England origin. Marie

</p><p>Saw your quiry on the Skinner family, sorry in the delay in responding. Haven't worked on this family in months, an the e-mail message didn't come to my home.
</p><p> 
</p><p>My Great Grandmother was Laura Alice Skinner/Keltner/James/ Marlow. As a young child Grandmother was adopted out with 5 of her siblings. They were taken to various family in the area who could feed an care for them. As a young adult her younger brother Elmer found her living with the adoptive family. This family took her in for a farm hand and worked her like a slave, even as a young child.
</p><p> 
</p><p>In doing the research more than once, the childern have been placed with other families. The Skinners in my line were quit poor, with alot of chilern.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Will include the family of Laura Alice

</p><p>On the 1860 Jackson Co. Ohio the census taker wrote the family name as SCINER. Had never considered the name being spelled that way, was lucky to have found it.

</p>
<p><p>Could you please send my email letter below to anyplace(s) any such query can be put, and please foreward this letter to anyone else you think might have a link to this family.
</p><p>I'm searching for connections, details and confirmation or corrections of my "known" data on my wife's Skinner ancestry, thus far from England to Illinois.
</p><p>The earliest definite Skinner from my wife's line that I know of was Robert Skinner, born May 1, 1801, near Ash Priors, a small community in Somerset Co, England. I don't know for sure when he died but it is likely @ Illinois, USA circa 1865. I have reason to believe he immigrated to the U.S. via NY in 1854/55 (have been unable to find the ship or immigration records) and soon thereafter came to Chicago, IL with his family. I believe but cannot confirm that his Father was John Skinner who married Elizabeth JOYCE 1794 @ Ash Priors, England. Unfortuntately there were 2 John Skinners born in Somerset Co, England during the era he was born. The most likely is from parents James & Phillis who had son John, born @ Chipstable in 1770, the other of parents John & Susannah born 1771 in Horsington. John's son Robert married Mary RICH about 1830, and had several children: Mary Jane, Sarah Ann, William Henry, Anna Maria, James & Elizabeth, all born between 1831 & 1842. About 1843 ? his wife, Mary died and within a few years (about 1844), Robert married Mary's younger sister, Ann RICH. They had children: Amelia, Rhoda, George & Henry all between 1845 & 1853. Ann & Robert Skinner emigrated with all of his children (we think) except the oldest two (Mary Jane & Sarah Ann), who we presumed remained in England

<p><p> 
</p><p>As I waded through all the Skinner interests your query caught my eye, a few coincidences I could not ignore! It may be merely that but I'll give you all the info I have. First, all my male Skinners were bootmakers or master shoemakers. My great-grandfather was William John Skinner born on 23.12 1894 in Marylebone,London, England. His parents were Joseph Skinner and Isabella Baillie. Joseph was a bootmaker.(he later had a shop in Kensington) he was born in Birkenhead,Cheshire on 23.11 1854 and died in 1907.
</p><p>Joseph's father came from the Isle of Man but had moved to Liverpool where there were other Skinner families. Thomas had a bootmakers shop and employed several other men and boys. This line goes back to 1771 on the Isle of Man and all those Skinner males seem to have been boot or shoemakers! The other coincidence - going forward again to my grandfather William - he was later 'left on the doorstep' of a family called Halls in Hatfield Broad Oak, Essex - nobody seems to know the exact details of when or why but he never knew his parents or why they had seemingly abandoned him. It's one of those lovely family mysteries everyone likes to chew on once in a while!
</p><p></p>
<p>That's all I have really except when we got Joseph's death certificate it was registered by his daughter,
</p><p></p>
<p>Daisy Skinner.....daughter?! where did she come from.
</p><p>Joseph had finally married Isabella in 1906 but sadly expired the following year!
</p><p>There's so many questions to be answered here and for my mum's sake I'd love to solve the mystery of her Dad!
</p><p>I have quite a bit of information on the Skinners in Liverpool - there are an awful lot of them. Ignore this waffle if it's no use to you but otherwise I'd be glad to assist in any way or would be pleased to receive any suggestions you may have for my research!

</p><p>All I can tell you about my ancestor, Richard, is that he arrived in Elizabethtown, NJ on August 1, 1665 aboard the Philip. He came over from the Isle of Jersey, one of the Channel Islands off the coast of France. He may have been there during the Cromwellian period and the Restoration of Charles the II. As to where we go from there is anybody's guess. I am trying to find out myself. Charles travelled from Scotland to Jersey, stopping at the Isle of Man and the Scillys off Cornwall. Also, a contingent of troops from Ireland came to Jersey after Charles arrived. A Captain Skinner informed the Govenor of Jersey, Sir George Carteret, of Charles the I beheading. Skinners are mostly a UK lot, ranging from the Skinner sept of the Clan Macgregor to gentry from Britian. Good luck and hope this helps

<p>I am looking for information about my gggrandfather, Joseph Churchill Skinner. I believe that he was born in Annapolis, NS in 1792. He entered the ministry and settled in Washdemoak Lake, NB. Family tradition says that our family fled Colchester, CT after the Revolution because of their Loyalist sympathies.
