<p>From:  Michael Libby mlibby@tasis.com
</p>
<p><p> 
</p><p>I am in search of information on an Elizabeth Skinner, married to a Richard Libby of Cornwall. Their last son(my great grandfather by
</p><p>adoption) William John Libby,was Born Jan,21, 1850 in Fowey. I am working mostly on the Skinner connection as I am related to the Skinners in Surrey. Spencer William and Maude Skinner were born to James and Elizabeth Ann Sarah (Charman) Skinner who died in child birth with Spencer, my grandfather. He and Maude were then sent to live and be raised as Libbys in Cornwall, by William John Libby and Jane Martin Penrose of the St. Agnes area in 1891.
</p><p> 
</p><p>I am searching to find the connection between the Surrey Skinners and the Cornwall Skinners if possible and as far as the the US for any possible connections.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Any info or connection would be great.
</p><p>Thanks,

</p><p>I am writing an article on a painting by Thomas Cole that Cole tried to sell to Aaron N. Skinner, dates are 1805-1858. Skinner resided in New Haven, graduated Yale, was a lawyer, ran a successful boys school, lived on Hillhouse Avenue (neighbor of Abraham Hillhouse), served in the CT House and Senate and was known for his involvement in New Haven civic life, and may have been responsible for the commission for the famous Egyptian wall for the Grove Street Cemetery.

</p>
<p>Date:  16 Jan 2001
</p>
<p>From:  Neil Middleham snoozer@ntlworld.com
</p>
<p><p> 
</p><p>I am just starting (well I've been getting round to it for months) doing some research into my Skinner ancestors. When I found your website with the search engine I thought I had hit the jackpot. I understand a little bit about computers and a little bit about family history but have little expertise or experience at either.
</p><p> 
</p><p>However, I tried a good number of different ways to search for my ancestors family and individuals within it but to no avail. I thought searching on the place where I know they came from (i.e Carlisle UK) would produce some success but the best hit was somebody with the surname Carlisle who was researching the name elsewhere.
</p><p> 
</p><p>I have a general question and a specific one. Generally, are you aware of anybody who is researching Skinners from Carlisle. If so I would be grateful for contact details as this would undoubtedly help.
</p><p> 
</p><p>I have managed to find my fathers maternal grandfather and his family on the 1881 and 1891 census. On the 1891 census the listing is for 11 Byron Street Carlisle and lists William aged 31, a carter; his wife Elizabeth aged 34; and children Henry 11, Elizabeth 8, Annie 5, Isabella 3, William 3m.
</p><p> 
</p><p>My grandmother Sarah Skinner was born on 15/11/1898 by which time the family are shown on her birth certificate as resident at 21 Byron Street, Carlisle. William snr, her father is shown as a wood sawyer (journeyman) and her mothers maiden name is Weightman.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Any information about this family or persons researching it would be warmly appreciated. However, my specific query is in relation to the deaths of William snr. and Elizabeth. It is a bit of a family mystery (or perhaps secret). All I know is that Sarah b1898 went to live with her elder sisters family before adulthood as her parents allegedly died. Of what they died, or of them, the family members I have spoken to claim no knowledge. Do you have data which would identify when and where they died so I could purchase death certificates.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Any help gratefully received. Do not worry about any delay in replying.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Kind Regards.

<p>Date:  4 Jun 2001
</p>
<p>From:  Bill Philbrick Philbrickw@aol.com
</p>
<p><p> 
</p><p>We are trying to locate information on a Jacob Skinner who married Viola Baldwin. Viola Baldwin was born in 1859 on Vesey Street (Wall Street area) in NY. Jacob died in the 1890's or late 1880's. His mother owned a boarding house in Brooklyn (where Viola went to live when Jacob died). They had two children, Rufus Skinner and Mary Skinner. Viola later had another child, Beatrice by a second marriage to Horton.
</p><p> 
</p><p>We know that Charles Rufus Skinner b. 1844 the educator and congressman from Watertown, NY married Elizabeth Baldwin in 1873. We think it may be more than a coincidence (i.e the name Rufus, and the Balddwin connection)
</p><p> 
</p><p>We have heard (from my great -grandmother, Mary Skinner Schmale, daughter of Jacob)) that they were related somehow to Cornelia Otis Skinner and her father (the writers).

</p>
<p>Date:  9 Oct 2001
</p>
<p>From:  "jsaremi" itsamejan@jps.net
</p>
<p><p> 
</p><p>I'm searching for information about my Glover family, who lived in Salem.
</p><p> 
</p><p>John Glover and his wife Mary (Guppy) had a daughter, Sarah, b. 1668 in Salem. She supposedly married John Skinner (b. 1673, Malden) and their marriage took place about 1696.
</p><p> 
</p><p>From the bits and pieces I've found, it seems that John and his brother, Thomas Skinner, decided not to move with the family to CT and instead they moved to Norton, MA where Thomas became the first school teacher there and married Hannah Carpenter.
</p><p> 
</p><p>I've found sites that say John married Sarah Porter....maybe he did but I know he was married to Sarah Glover first. In the Essex County Probate Records, Vol. 20, leaf 132, O.S., it lists the distributees of the estate of Sarah's brother, John Glover and Sarah's name is mentioned "The Representatives of Sarah Glover alias Skinner" with the date Jan. 6, 1736.
</p><p> 
</p><p>I'm hoping someone knows about John and Sarah's life in Norton....how many children they had and what John did for a living. I'd also like to know if they divorced and when. Sarah apparently stayed in Norton for the rest of her life when she could have gone home to Salem where she had a very large family. The fact that she stayed there makes me feel she and John stayed together (and he didn't marry Sarah Porter) or that she had several children living there and didn't want to move away from them.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Thank you for any information you can send my way.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Sincerely,
</p><p>Jan Saremi

James Thorpe had two children, one of whom was Adeline, the other was Thomas Jefferson Thorpe, b. 1818, and married to Elizabeth Skinner, b. 1820 in Salt Lick Twp., Fayette Co., Pa.

</p>
<p><p> 
</p><p>I am writing to you because I have seen your web page on the Internet. I am working on a booklet that will cover my hobby that has researched my paternal ancestors over the last 7 years starting from 1. Reverend William Skinner 2. Brigadier Courtlandt Skinner 3. Captain John Macgregor Skinner RN 4. John McGregor Skinner 5. John Frederick McGregor Skinner 6. Leslie Courtland McGregor-Skinner 7. John Leslie Macgregor-Skinner 8. Me. I plan to distribute the booklet free to anyone who is interested and it will be a living document that many can contribute, correct and expand. I hope it will be a lot of fun not just for myself but everyone else who would like to be involved. I hope that it will eventually cover all descendants of Reverend William Skinner. I am not sure on the format as yet but I would like it to be readily accessible and be able to be updated.
</p><p> 
</p><p>In the booklet I will also list all the people who have kindly sent me information over the years, and I am working on getting permission from them. There is also some information that I am not allowed to publish, due to copyright and professional researchers working on their own projects. This is my hobby and I respect the fact that there are people who do this for a living.
</p><p>If you would like to contribute to the booklet, it would be my pleasure to hear from you. I will have the booklet out by Xmas 2002.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Kind Regards
</p><p>Gavin</p></p>
