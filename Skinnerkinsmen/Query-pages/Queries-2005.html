</p><p>Hi, found your website. My name is David Skinner, the oldest of 3 boys. My dad's grandfather was Ike Skinner, who was born in 1858, and moved to Montague County, Texas. He was one of three brothers; John (the oldest) who settled in Oklahoma (?) and third brother that we've been unable to identify.
</p><p>Any thoughts on how I could pursue our family tree. Both my parents are gone now, and we don't have much info. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks,
</p><p>David Skinner</p></p>
